<h1> flow_chart language specification </h1>

<span class="author"> Miloslav Číž, 2014 </span>

<p> This is a specification of flow_chart esoteric language. </p>

<h2> a brief characteristics of the language </h2>

<p>
The language is interpreted and its inputs are images of flow charts.
It is high level, functions and recursion is supported as well as
common data types including strings and lists.
</p>

<h2> syntax </h2>

<p>
The source code medium of flow_chart is, unlike with most computer
languages, a raster image in PNG or BMP format. However the image should
be, unlike with for example Piet, human readable as it represents a
flow chart. We'll suppose the image is represented as an 2D array of RGB
values, as is common, however, the language is designed to only use
black and white color in order to be easily printable on paper, though
other colors are allowed to be used (they'll just be ignored). The black
colors means [0,0,0] RGB value, the white means [255,255,255] RGB value.
</p>

<h3> blocks and connections </h3>

<p>
There exist three types ob blocks that the flow chart consists of, they
are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    command - Contains a command string (&lt;CMD&gt;), there goes
    exactly one connection in the block and up to one connection out
    (if the command is the last command in the function, there is
    no connection going out).
  </li>
  <li>
    branching - Contains a condition string (&lt;COND&gt;), there
    goes exactly one connection in and exactly two connections out
    ("then" and "else" branches).
  </li>
  <li> function - Contains a function definition string (&lt;FUNC&gt;),
    there goes no connection in and exactly one connection out.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The bloocks look like this:
</p>

<p>
The width and height of the blocks doesn't matter, but they cannot be
empty so the theoretical minimum size depends on the size of a single
text character. The block border must always be black and one pixel
wide. The function start block must always have double line
border with exactly one non-black pixel between the two border lines,
as in the picture. The branching block left (right) border must be a
line that starts going one pixel left (right) and one down, then at
some point it must change to going one pixel right (left) and one down,
before it connects to the bottom border line of the block. Therefore
other possible valid blocks can look like this:
<p>

<p>
A block must always contain a non-empty string. The string can be
placed anywhere inside the block, it can even touch the border, but it
must not overlap it. The text must be written in black color and
it must use the font described in this document.
</p>

<p>
The blocks are connected using lines with arrows (which represent the
control flow):
</p>

<p>
The lines can overlap in a way that's apparent from the picture - one of
the lines must have a one pixel white border around it in order to
distinguish the two lines from each other. The arrow must have exactly
the shape as in the picture, it can be pointing in each of four
directions (left, right, up, bottom).
</p>

<p>
Each line must always be connecting either two blocks or a block to
another line. It doesn't matter at which point the line
comes from or into a block or a line (its direction is decided by the
arrow) with the exception of branching block, where the input and "then"
lines must come either to/from the top border or to/from bottom border
and the "else" line must come from the tip of either left or right
border line. The followinf picture shows some valid block connections:

<h3> font </h3>

<p>
The language uses its own fixed size ASCII font to represent text
elements. The character size is 7 x 8 pixels and there is exactly one
pixel space between the characters.
</p>

<h3> text syntax </h3>

<p>
  The following grammar describes the syntax of the language text
  elements:
</p>

<table>
  <tr> <td> &lt;CMD&gt; </td> <td> &#10141; </td> <td> </td> </tr>

</table>

<p> </p>
