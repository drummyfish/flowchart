<h1> flow_chart language specification </h1>

<span class="author"> Miloslav Číž, 2014 </span>

<p> This is a specification of flow_chart esoteric language. </p>

<h2> a brief characteristics of the language </h2>

<p>
flow_chart is high-level, imperative (routine-based), interpreted
language, whose inputs are raster images of flow charts.
Recursion is supported as well as common data types including strings
and lists.
</p>

<h2> syntax </h2>

<p>
The source code medium of flow_chart is, unlike with most computer
languages, a raster image in PNG or BMP format. However, the image
should be, unlike with for example Piet, human readable as it represents a
flow chart. We'll suppose the image is represented as an 2D array of RGB
values, as is common, however, the language is designed to only use
black and white color in order to be easily printable on paper, though
other colors are allowed to be used (they'll just be ignored). The black
colors means [0,0,0] RGB value, the white means [255,255,255] RGB value.
</p>

<h3> blocks and connections </h3>

<p>
There exist four types ob blocks that the flow chart consists of, they
are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    command - Contains a command string (&lt;CMD&gt;), there goes
    a minimum of one connection to the block and up to one connection out
    (if the command is the last command in the function, there is
    no connection going out).
  </li>
  <li>
    branching - Contains a condition string (&lt;COND&gt;), there
    goes up to one connection in and exactly two connections out
    ("then" and "else" branches).
  </li>
  <li>
    function - Contains a function definition string (&lt;FUNC&gt;),
    there goes no connection in and exactly one connection out.
  </li>
  <li>
    directive - Contains directive information string (&lt;DIR&gt;),
    such as includes, global variables or constants. There can only be
    one directive block in one program
    image and this block can have no connections, it just serves as
    program header.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The bloocks look like this:
</p>

<p>
The width and height of the blocks doesn't matter, but they cannot be
empty so the theoretical minimum size depends on the size of a single
text character. The block border must always be black and one pixel
wide. The function start block must always have three-pixel wide border.
The directive border must have double border consisting of one black,
one non black and one black pixels, as in the picture.
The branching block left (right) border must be a
line that starts going one pixel left (right) and one down, then at
some point it must change to going one pixel right (left) and one down,
before it connects to the bottom border line of the block. Therefore
other possible valid blocks can look like this:
<p>

<p>
The following examples are wrong:
</p>

<img src="images/blocks_bad.png" alt="other possible blocks" />

<p>
A block must always contain a non-empty string. The string can be
placed anywhere inside the block, it can even touch the border, but it
must not overlap it. The text must be written in black color and
it must use the font described in this document.
</p>

<p>
The blocks are connected using one-pixel wide straight (horizontal or
vertical) lines with arrows (which represent the control flow) as in
the picture:
</p>

<img src="images/lines.png" alt="lines" />

<p>
The lines can overlap in a way that's apparent from the picture - one of
the lines must have a one pixel white border around it in order to
distinguish the two lines from each other. The arrow must have exactly
the shape as in the picture, it can be pointing in each of four
directions (left, right, up, bottom).
</p>

<p>
Each line must always be connecting exactly two blocks that are
connected to the same function block (that means there can be no goto
from within one function to another). It doesn't
matter at which point the line
comes from or into a block or a line (its direction is decided by the
arrow) with the exception of branching block, where the input and "then"
lines must come either to/from the top border or to/from bottom border
and the "else" line must come from the tip of either left or right
border line. The followinf picture shows some valid block connections:

<h3> comments </h3>

<p>
Comments can be writen (or drawn) anywhere as long as they are other
color than black and they do not interfere with the code. The reason
for this is that the interpreter only recognises black and non-black
pixels.
</p>

<h3> font </h3>

<p>
The language uses its own fixed size extended ASCII font to represent text
elements. The character size is 7&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;8 pixels and there is exactly one
pixel space between the characters. The font characters look like this
(starting from top left, going to bottom right with 1 pixel space between
rows and columns)
</p>

<img src="images/font.png" alt="font" />

<p>
Language interpreters may include the possibility to provide custom
font maps but the program is then formally not in pure flow_chart which
only supports the font given above.
</p>

<h3> text syntax </h3>

<p>
The language is case-sensitive. The following grammar describes the
syntax of the language text elements:
</p>

<table>
  <tr> <td> &lt;CMD&gt; </td>      <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;ASSIGN&gt; | &lt;CALL&gt; | return &lt;EXP&gt; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;ASSIGN&gt; </td>   <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;VAR&gt; &#8592; &lt;EXP&gt; | &lt;INIT&gt; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;INIT&gt; </td>     <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> list </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;VAR&gt; </td>      <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; | &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; [ &lt;EXP&gt; ] </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;EXP&gt; </td>      <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> ( &lt;EXP&gt; ) | &lt;VAR&gt; | &lt;CALL&gt; | &lt;CONST&gt; | &lt;EXP&gt; &lt;OP&gt; &lt;EXP&gt; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;OP&gt; </td>       <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> + | - | &#247; | / | * | &#215; | % | <img src="images/mod.png" /> </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;CONST&gt; </td>    <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;INT&gt; | &lt;FLOAT&gt; | &lt;STRING&gt; | &lt;BOOL&gt; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;COND&gt; </td>     <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;EXP&gt; &lt;CMP&gt; &lt;EXP&gt; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;CMP&gt; </td>      <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> = | &ne; | "&lt;" | "&gt;" | &ge; | &le; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;CALL&gt; </td>     <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; ( &lt;PARAMS&gt; ) </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;FUNC&gt; </td>     <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; ( &lt;PARAM_LIST&gt; ) </td> </tr>

  <tr> <td> &lt;DIR&gt; </td>      <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> uses &lt;PATH&gt; | &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; = &lt;CONST&gt; | &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; &#8592; &lt;CONST&gt; </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
Some of the above nonterminals are described by regexps:
</p>

<table>
  <tr> <td> &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; </td> <td> := </td>   <td> ([a-Z] | "_") (([a-Z] | [0-9] | "_")*) </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;FLOAT&gt; </td>      <td> := </td>   <td>  </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;BOOL&gt; </td>       <td> := </td>   <td> "true" | "false" </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;STRING&gt; </td>     <td> := </td>   <td> \" () \" </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
The language keywords (that of course can't be used as identifiers) are
shown in the following list:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> false </li>
  <li> list </li>
  <li> main </li>
  <li> return </li>
  <li> true </li>
</ul>

<h2> semantics </h2>

<h1> data types </h1>

<p>
There are four atomic and one composite data types in flow_chart. These
are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    int - Holds at least 16-bit signed integer value.
  </li>

  <li>
    float - Floating point number in at least single precision.
  </li>

  <li>
    string - String of ASCII characters.
  </li>

  <li>
    bool - Holds exactly one of two values: true or false.
  </li>

  <li>
    list - List is the only composite data type. It serves as dynamic
    heterogenous array of values or other lists. It's behavior is
    similar to lists in Python. The indexing uses int values (including
    negative values).
  </li>

</ul>

overloading?
</p>

<h1> function calls </h1>

<p>
Recursion, even indirect, is allowed. Parameters of atomic data types
(int, float,
string and bool) are passed by value, lists are passed by reference.
The function can return any atomic data type, lists can't be returned.
</p>

<h1> built-in functions </h1>

<ul>
  <li> print(what) - </li>
  <li> open_file(filename): int - Opens file named <i>filename</i> (it must be string, otherwise nothing happens) and returns its positive integer handle, in case of error -1 is returned. </li>
  <li> close_file(handle) - Close file with given handle, if <i>handle</i> isn't of int type or it is negative or it is not asociated with any file, nothing happens. </li>


  <li> read(file_handle) - </li>
  <li> read() - </li>
  <li> read_string(): string - </li>
  <li> read_int(): string - </li>
  <li> read_float(): string - </li>
  <li> wait(milliseconds) - </li>
  <li> type(what): string - </li>
  <li> length(what): int - Returns length of given <i>what</i> list or -1 if <i>what</i> is not a list. </li>
</ul>
