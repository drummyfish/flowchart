<h1> flow_chart language specification </h1>

<span class="version"> version 0.1 </span>

<br />

<span class="author"> Miloslav Číž, 2014 </span>

<p> This is a specification of flow_chart esoteric language. </p>

<h2> a brief characteristics of the language </h2>

<p>
flow_chart is high-level, imperative (routine-based), interpreted
language, whose inputs are raster images of flow charts.
Recursion is supported as well as common data types including strings
and lists.
</p>

<h2> interpreter </h2>

<p>
The following paragraphs say the basic idea about the language
interpreter. These are mostly ideas and recommedations as this document
mainly focuses on the language itself, however because the language was
designed with the interpreter idea in mind, anyone implementing the
interpreter should read this chapter and consider following it as
closely as possible.
</p>

<p>
The language is intended and designed to be interpreted, using bytecode
is very recommended. The interpreter should be user friendly as is
usually common with mose copilers/interpreters. If there is any syntax
or semantics error in the program, the interpreter must let the user
know and provide them with following information (with exception of
bytecode without debug information):
</p>

<ul>
  <li> error type - syntax, compile-time semantic or run-time semantic </li>
  <li> place where the error occured in pixture [x,y] pixel coordinates </li>
  <li> additional details, i.e. which action exactly caused the error </li>
</ul>

<p>
The interpreter may print multiple syntax errors that happen during
program compile.
</p>

<p>
The interpreter should be able to produce bytecode only and should be
able to interpret it even without source code (image) present. The bytecode can
be generated either with or without debug information. The debug
information will allow the interpreter to still inform the user about
run-time errors just as if the program was interpreted from source code.
If the debug information is not present in the bytecode, the interpreter
will only inform the user there was an error and what kind of action
it was caused by, but it mustn't say anything more.
</p>

<h2> syntax </h2>

<p>
The source code medium of flow_chart is, unlike with most computer
languages, a raster image in PNG or BMP format. However, the image
should be, unlike with for example Piet, human readable as it represents a
flow chart. We'll suppose the image is represented as an 2D array of RGB
values, as is common, however, the language is designed to only use
black and white color in order to be easily printable on paper, though
other colors are allowed to be used (they'll just be ignored). The black
color means [0,0,0] RGB value, the white means [255,255,255] RGB value
(if there is also an alpha channel, it is ignored).
</p>

<h3> blocks and connections </h3>

<p>
There exist four types ob blocks that the flow chart consists of, they
are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    command - Contains a command string (&lt;CMD&gt;), there goes
    a minimum of one connection to the block and up to one connection out
    (if the command is the last command in the function, there is
    no connection going out).
  </li>
  <li>
    branching - Contains a condition string (&lt;COND&gt;), there
    goes up to one connection in and exactly two connections out
    ("then" and "else" branches).
  </li>
  <li>
    function - Contains a function definition string (&lt;FUNC&gt;),
    there goes no connection in and exactly one connection out.
  </li>
  <li>
    directive - Contains directive information string (&lt;DIR&gt;),
    such as includes, global variables or constants. There can only be
    one directive block in one program
    image and this block can have no connections, it just serves as
    program header.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The bloocks look like this:
</p>

<img src="images/blocks.png" alt="blocks" />

<p>
The width and height of the blocks doesn't matter, but they cannot be
empty so the theoretical minimum size depends on the size of a single
text character. The block border must always be black and one pixel
wide. The function start block must always have three-pixel wide border.
The directive border must have double border consisting of one black,
one non black and one black pixels, as in the picture.
The branching block left (right) border must be a
line that starts going one pixel left (right) and one down, then at
some point it must change to going one pixel right (left) and one down,
before it connects to the bottom border line of the block. Therefore
other possible valid blocks can look like this:
<p>

<img src="images/blocks2.png" alt="other possible blocks" />

<p>
The following examples are wrong:
</p>

<img src="images/blocks_bad.png" alt="other possible blocks" />

<p>
A block must always contain a non-empty string. The string can be
placed anywhere inside the block, it can't touch the border and it
must not overlap it. The text must be written in black color and
it must use the font described in this document.
</p>

<p>
The blocks are connected using one-pixel wide straight (horizontal or
vertical) lines with arrows (which represent the control flow) as in
the picture:
</p>

<img src="images/lines.png" alt="lines" />

<p>
The lines can overlap in a way that's apparent from the picture - one of
the lines must have a one pixel white border around it in order to
distinguish the two lines from each other. The arrow must have exactly
the shape as in the picture, it can be pointing in each of four
directions (left, right, up, bottom).
</p>

<p>
Each line must always be connecting exactly two blocks that are
connected to the same function block (that means there can be no goto
from within one function to another). It doesn't
matter at which point the line
comes from or into a block or a line (its direction is decided by the
arrow) with the exception of branching block, where the input and "then"
lines must come either to/from the top border or to/from bottom border
and the "else" line must come from the tip of either left or right
border line. The followinf picture shows some valid block connections:
</p>

<img src="images/connections.png" alt="possible connections" />

<p>
The folowing examples are wrong:
</p>

<img src="images/connections_bad.png" alt="possible connections" />

<h3> comments </h3>

<p>
Comments can be writen (or drawn) anywhere as long as they are other
color than black and they do not interfere with the code. The reason
for this is that the interpreter only recognises black and non-black
pixels.
</p>

<h3> font </h3>

<p>
The language uses its own fixed size extended ASCII font to represent text
elements. The character size is 7&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;8 pixels and there is exactly one
pixel space between the characters. The font characters look like this
(starting from top left, going to bottom right with 1 pixel space between
rows and columns)
</p>

<img src="images/font.png" alt="font" />

<p>
Language interpreters may include the possibility to provide custom
font maps but the program is then formally not in pure flow_chart which
only supports the font given above.
</p>

<h3> text syntax </h3>

<p>
The language is case-sensitive. The following grammar describes the
syntax (and only syntax, not expression evaluation order etc.) of the
language text elements:
</p>

<tt>
<table>
  <tr> <td> command: </td> <td> &lt;CMD&gt; </td>      <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;ASSIGN&gt; | &lt;CALL&gt; | return &lt;EXP&gt; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> assign: </td> <td> &lt;ASSIGN&gt; </td>   <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;VAR&gt; &#8592; &lt;EXP&gt; | &lt;INIT&gt; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> list constructor: </td> <td> &lt;INIT&gt; </td>     <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> list </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> variable or list item: </td> <td> &lt;VAR&gt; </td>      <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;IDENTIFIER_NS&gt; | &lt;IDENTIFIER_NS&gt; [ &lt;EXP&gt; ] </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> expression: </td> <td> &lt;EXP&gt; </td>      <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> ( &lt;EXP&gt; ) | &lt;VAR&gt; | &lt;CALL&gt; | &lt;CONST&gt; | &lt;EXP&gt; &lt;OP&gt; &lt;EXP&gt; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> operator: </td> <td> &lt;OP&gt; </td>       <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> + | - | &#247; | / | * | &#215; | % | <img src="images/mod.png" /> | &#172; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> literal: </td> <td> &lt;CONST&gt; </td>    <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;INT&gt; | &lt;FLOAT&gt; | &lt;STRING&gt; | &lt;BOOL&gt; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> condition: </td> <td> &lt;COND&gt; </td>     <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;EXP&gt; &lt;CMP&gt; &lt;EXP&gt; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> comparison operators: </td> <td> &lt;CMP&gt; </td>      <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> = | &ne; | "&lt;" | "&gt;" | &ge; | &le; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> function call: </td> <td> &lt;CALL&gt; </td>     <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;IDENTIFIER_NS&gt; ( &lt;PARAMS&gt; ) </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> function header: </td> <td> &lt;FUNC&gt; </td>     <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; ( &lt;PARAM_LIST&gt; ) | &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; () </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> formal parameter list: </td> <td> &lt;PARAM_LIST&gt; </td>     <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; | &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; , &lt;PARAM_LIST&gt; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> optional namespace + identifier: </td> <td> &lt;IDENTIFIER_NS&gt; </td>     <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; : &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt;| &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> directive: </td> <td> &lt;DIR&gt; </td>      <td> &#10141; </td>   <td> include &lt;PATH&gt; | &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; = &lt;CONST&gt; | &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; &#8592; &lt;CONST&gt; | namespace &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; </td> </tr>
</table>
</tt>

<p>
Some of the above nonterminals are described by regexps:
</p>

<tt>
<table>
  <tr> <td> &lt;IDENTIFIER&gt; </td> <td> := </td>   <td> ([a-Z] | "_") (([a-Z] | [0-9] | "_")*) </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;FLOAT&gt; </td>      <td> := </td>   <td>  </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;BOOL&gt; </td>       <td> := </td>   <td> "true" | "false" </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> &lt;STRING&gt; </td>     <td> := </td>   <td> \" () \" </td> </tr>
</table>
</tt>

<p>
The language keywords (that of course can't be used as identifiers) are
shown in the following list:
</p>

<tt>
<ul>
  <li> false </li>
  <li> list </li>
  <li> main </li>
  <li> return </li>
  <li> true </li>
  <li> stdin </li>
  <li> stderr </li>
  <li> stdout </li>
</ul>
</tt>

<p>
besides these, built-in function identifiers can neither be used for user
identifiers (see <a href="#builtin">built-in functions</a>).
</p>

<h2> semantics </h2>

<h3> data types </h3>

<p>
There are four atomic and one composite data types in flow_chart. These
are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    int - Holds at least 16-bit signed integer value.
  </li>

  <li>
    float - Floating point number in at least single precision.
  </li>

  <li>
    string - String of ASCII characters.
  </li>

  <li>
    bool - Holds exactly one of two values: true or false.
  </li>

  <li>
    list - List is the only composite data type. It serves as dynamic
    heterogenous array of values or other lists. It's behavior is
    similar to lists in Python. The indexing uses int values. Negative
    values can be used for indexing, but they behave differently than
    in Python, i.e. index -1 doesn't address the last position in the
    list but rather an unique position "-1".
  </li>

</ul>

<h3> variables </h3>

<p>
flow_chart is dynamic-typed, that means that variables can change type
during runtime. A new variable is created when it is first assigned to,
using "&#8592;" symbol.
</p>

<p>
There can be global variables, see section
<a href="#global_directives">global directives</a>.
</p>

<p>
A function has only access to its own variables (variables declared
inside itself and only within the concrete instance of the function
during recursion) and global variables, not to the callee's variables
though. If there is a global variable of some name, let's say <i>a</i>,
there cannot be any local variable with that name, <i>a</i>, anywhere
else in the program, as it cannot be created, because this is done by
assignement which in this case just causes assignment to already
existing global variable. This should be reported as an error at
compile-time.
</p>

<h3 id="global_directives"> global directives </h3>

<p>
Global variables can be declared inside directive blocks. To declare a
global variable it must also be initialised with a value, using
"&#8592;" symbol.
</p>

<p>
Besides global variables, global constants can be declared as well.
Constants can only be read, any attempt to write to a global constant
must result in compile-time error. In order to declare a global constant
a value must be linked to it, using "=" symbol.
</p>

<h3 id="cf"> control flow </h3>

<p>
Programs in flow_chart are always single thread only.
</p>

<p>
The program starts its execution in <tt>main()</tt> function, named exactly
<tt>main</tt> and having zero parameters, which must be defined in the program
being run. If such function doesn't exist, the interpreter yields a
compile-time error.
</p>

<p>
The program then proceeds to the next block that is marked with one
outcoming arrow, then to another one and so on, until the end main
function is exited either by executing its last block (in which case
0 is returned to the operating system) or by <tt>return</tt> command
(in which case the return command's value is returned to the operating
system, or 0 if it's not of integer data type) or by calling built-in
<tt>halt()</tt>/<tt>halt(value)</tt> function from anywhere within the
program being run (the value returned to the operating system is
specified in the description of the <tt>halt(value)</tt> function).
</p>

<p>
If function call (&lt;CALL&gt; grammar element) <i>f(p<sub>1</sub>,p<sub>2</sub>,...,p<sub>n</sub>)</i> is
encountered during program execution, the control is set to the
starting block of the function named <i>f</i> that expects exactly <i>n</i>
parameters, i.e. it's header is <i>f(q<sub>1</sub>,q<sub>2</sub>,...,q<sub>n</sub>)</i>.
New local variables named <i>q<sub>1</sub> ... q<sub>n</sub></i> are then
created and assigned values <i>p<sub>1</sub> ... p<sub>2</sub></i> in this
order. The variables <i>q<sub>1</sub> ... q<sub>n</sub></i> are local to
the instance of the function <i>f</i>, that means that they are different
from any other variables named <i>q<sub>1</sub> ... q<sub>n</sub></i>
anywhere in the program except for the body of the function <i>f</i> and
they are also different from the same named variables in another instance
of the function <i>f</i> during recursion, indeed. The variables
<i>q<sub>1</sub> ... q<sub>n</sub></i> are destroyed when the function
<i>f</i> ends.

For more information on functions see the section <a href="#func">functions</a>.
</p>

<p>
Branching is achieved using the branching blocks. Each block must
contain exactly one condition written accoording to &lt;COND&gt;
grammar element. The condition is always an comparison. If the value
of the comparison is true, the program flow continues with "then"
branch (coming from top or bottom of the block), otherwise the program
proceeds to "else" branch (coming from either left or right, see
the syntax section for more).
</p>

<p>
Loops are achieved via branching, as is common with flow charts.
</p>

<h3> expressions </h3>

<p>
Operator priority is as follows:
</p>

<table class="normal_table">
  <tr> <th> priority </th> <th> operators </th> </tr>
  <tr> <td> 1 (highest) </td> <td> ( ) [] </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> 2 </td> <td> &#172; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> 3 </td> <td> &#215; &#247; </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> 4 </td> <td> <img src="images/mod.png" /> </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> 5 </td> <td> + - </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
The following table explains the operator semantics. Using the operator
with data types that are not allowed results either in compile-time (if
the data types are known at compile time) or run-time (otherwise) error.
</p>

<table class="normal_table">
  <tr> <th> operator(s) </th>                                         <th> operand types </th>  <th> result type </th>  <th> description </th>    </tr>
  <tr> <td rowspan="4"> a + b, a - b, a &#215; b                </td> <td> int int       </td>  <td> int </td>          <td rowspan="4"> addition, substraction and multiplication </td> </tr>
  <tr>                                                                <td> float float   </td>  <td> float </td>                                  </tr>
  <tr>                                                                <td> int float     </td>  <td> float </td>                                  </tr>
  <tr>                                                                <td> float int     </td>  <td> float </td>                                  </tr>

  <tr>                                                           <td> float float       </td> <td> float </td>                  </tr>
  <tr>                                                           <td> int float       </td> <td> float </td>                  </tr>
  <tr>                                                           <td> float int       </td> <td> float </td>                  </tr>

</table>

<h3 id="func"> functions </h3>

<p>
Recursion, even indirect, is allowed. Parameters of atomic data types
(int, float,
string and bool) are passed by value, lists are passed by reference.
The function can return any atomic data type, lists can't be returned.
</p>

<p>
Function parameters behave just as if they were variables created at the
beginning of the function.
</p>

<p>
Function declaration and definition are the same thing in flow_chart,
which means you declare the function as soon as you define it - there
are no forward declarations as there is no "forward" and "backward" in
the source image.
</p>

<p>
Overloading is allowed, however it can only be used to make multiple
functions of the same name that differ only by number of parameters
since functions don't define the data types of their parameters.
</p>

<p>
Function return values are also not specified. Function can return any
value it wishes and it can return different data types at different
times. If the function ends without returning a value, boolean false
value is returned implicitly.
</p>

<p>

<a href="#cf">control flow</a>.

<h3> modules </h3>

<p>
A program in flow_char can be separated into modules, which means its
source code consists of multiple images in separate files. There is
always a main module, which is the one where the <tt>main()</tt>
function is defined.
</p>

<p>
To include additional modules into the main module, a directive block
must be put in the main file with <tt>include "path"</tt> string in it
(see grammar section), where <tt>path</tt> is the filepath of the module
being included.
</p>

<p>
When the module <i>m</i> is included in the program <i>p</i>, it is
possible to use all the functions, global variables and global constants
from <i>m</i> just as if they were declared/defined in <i>p</i>.
Multiple include directives can be present in the program, even
referencing the same module, though it is included only once in that
case.
</p>

<p>
flow_chart supports module namespaces, though they needn't be used if
not necesarry. If there is a symbol (function, global variable or global
constant) <i>a</i> in both module <i>m</i> and module <i>p</i> and
<i>m</i> is included from within <i>p</i>, then when <i>a</i> is used
inside <i>p</i>, <i>a</i> decalred/defined in <i>p</i> is referenced
by default. To use <i>a</i> declared/defined in <i>m</i> in this case it
is needed to create a namespace by putting a directive in <i>m</i> with
string <tt>namespace name</tt> where <tt>name</tt> is the name of the
namespace for <i>m</i>. A maximum of one namespace directive can be
present in any one file, otherwise a compile-time error must occur.
After creating the namespace <i>p</i> can reference the above <i>a</i>
symbol from <i>m</i> with the syntax <tt>name:</tt><i>a</i>.
</p>

<p>
The include directive causes the interpreter to load the module
internally if it hasn't already been loaded, so it's allowed to even
have cyclic dependencies between modules formed via include
directives (<i>m</i> includes <i>p</i> and <i>p</i> includes
<i>m</i>).
